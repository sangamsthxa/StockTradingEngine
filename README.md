##  **Key Features**

1. **Lock-Free Synchronization:**
   - Uses `synchronized` blocks to manage concurrency control for adding and matching orders.
   - Prevents deadlocks and minimizes context switching.

2. **Efficient Order Matching:**
   - Matches buy and sell orders based on price and availability.
   - Ensures real-time execution with a time complexity of **O(n)**.

3. **Supports High Concurrency:**
   - Designed to handle multiple threads for order placement and matching.
   - Suitable for multi-core systems.

4. **Fixed-Size Arrays:**
   - Uses fixed-size arrays for order books.
   - Avoids dynamic data structures like `HashMap` or `ArrayList` as per requirements.

5. **Real-Time Performance:**
   - Implements non-blocking data access for low-latency performance.
